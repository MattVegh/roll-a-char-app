To roll a character you can input your character's name and choose their gender/race/class, or leave some of the fields blank and let the app decide!

When you roll a character the app will generate the ability scores and assign them appropriately. You can also input a little backstory for your character to add some flavor before you save them.

* I got the idea for this app when I joined a D&D group recently. Thought it would be a fun project to create. My DM likes to use it to make NPCs for his campaigns.
